# Pinterest Clone

Final project of the Kata Intro to the web module that consists of cloning the home page of Pinterest.

Technologies: HTML5 and CSS3 Deployment in Firebase and change control in Git.

What and how it was implemented:

I developed the HTML5 code based on semantic structure, the layout was done with Flexbox and only in two parts I used JavaScript (which is out of scope).
